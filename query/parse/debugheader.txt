* The main reason this file has been generated and submitted is to try to ensure
* we never submit changes that cause shift/reduce or reduce/reduce conflicts.
* The Go yacc tool doesn't support the %expect directive, and will happily
* generate a parser even if such conflicts exist; it's up to the developer
* running the tool to notice that an error message is reported.  The bottom of
* this file contains stats, including the number of conflicts.  If you're
* reviewing a change make sure it says 0 conflicts.
*
* If you're updating the grammar, just cut-and-paste this message from the old
* file to the new one, so that this comment block persists.
