// BlessingPattern is a pattern that is matched by specific blessings.
//
// A pattern can be either a blessing (slash-separated human-readable string)
// or a blessing ending in a glob ("/..."). A blessing matches a pattern if it
// can be extended to produce the same string as the pattern.  For example, the
// pattern "a/b/c" is matched by the blessings "a", "a/b" and "a/b/c" but not
// "x", not "a/x", not "a/b/x" and not "a/b/c/x".
//
// Additionally, when the pattern ends with a glob ("/..."), it is matched by
// all blessings that represent delegates of the pattern string excluding the
// glob. For example, the pattern "a/b/c/..." is matched by all the patterns
// that match "a/b/c" ("a", "a/b", "a/b/c") and all delegates of "a/b/c" (like
// "a/b/c/d", "a/b/c/d/e" etc.).
